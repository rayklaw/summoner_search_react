# React Web Front End Sample Using Hooks

This folder contains a very simple React-based web front end sample that uses the [Giphy API](https://api.giphy.com) to search for then display matching animated GIFs. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The most recent version of its guide can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

The “style” of component used here is “hook”-based (introduced in [React 16.8](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)): i.e., components are defined via a function, with state and other behavior implemented using “hook” functions.

## Setup

From a fresh clone, run `npm install`.

## Execution

To see the site locally, run `npm start` then visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Tests

Run tests with `npm test`. Look at your test coverage with `npm test -- --coverage`.

## Build/Deploy

Create a deployment-ready build with `npm run build`.

## Style/Component Libraries

If you don’t feel like styling your components yourself, you might consider the following:
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com): A convenient and powerful collection of icons and glyphs—they have a free set which anyone may use
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/): React components that implement Google’s Material Design
- [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/): React components that mimic Bootstrap 4

Not style-related, but still potentially useful, is [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/). This allows your application to serve up multiple URLs while still retaining a unified code base:
